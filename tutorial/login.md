# Logging into the NYU Wireless FPGA server

The NYU Wireless lab has a dedicated high performance machine for running the FPGA tools.  If you wish to avoid installing the software on your own computer, you can log into this machine.
The machine is shared, so you will need to coordinate with others to ensure you are not using the machine simultaneously.

To log into the machine:

* Email [Sundeep Rangan](mailto:srangan@nyu.edu) to request a user name and password for an account on the server.
* Install any ssh client on your local machine.
* Log in at the IP address:  172.24.113.58 with the requested user name and password.
