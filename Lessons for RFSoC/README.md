### Other Educational material 
[Here](https://xilinx.github.io/RFSoC2x2-PYNQ/educational_resources.html) you can find a lot more educational material to support the Zynq RFSoC and the RFSoC2x2. This content has been developed by the University of Strathclyde in partnership with Xilinx. We recommend following these [RFSoC introductory notebooks](https://github.com/strath-sdr/rfsoc_notebooks). We encourage you to begin this class by covering these notebooks first. [Lesson 1](http://192.168.3.1:9090/lab/workspaces/auto-a/tree/rfsoc-notebooks/01_rfsoc_architecture_overview.ipynb) is particularly insightful to get you started. 


### Working with the RFSoC 2x2 remotely

The RFSoC 2x2 board is connected to a Workstation in Prof. Rangan's Wireless Lab at NYU. This machine can be accessed remotely using tools such as RealVCN or Screen Sharing (for MAC users) using the following credentials:
 
IP Address       : 172.24.113.58

RealVNC Password : ask Prof. Rangan

Login Password   : ask Prof. Rangan


### Enable internet connectivity on the RFSoC 2x2

Remember to enable internet connectivity on the board. Ideally, you use a USB-Ethernet adapter on the host machine. Otherwise, if you connect the board directly to the host computer through the Ethernet port, you should follow the instructions reported [here](https://github.com/nyu-wireless/mmwsdr/blob/main/Lessons%20for%20RFSoC/Tips/Connectivity.md).
