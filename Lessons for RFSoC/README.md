### Working with the RFSoC 2x2 remotely

The RFSoC 2x2 board is connected to a Workstation in Prof. Rangan's Wireless Lab at NYU. This machine can be accessed remotely using tools such as RealVCN or Screen Sharing (for MAC users) using the following credentials:
 
IP Address       : 172.24.113.58

RealVNC Password : nyu@1234

Login Password   : nyu@1234

Remember to enable internet connectivity on the board by connecting it to the host computer over Ethernet, and by selecting "Shared to other computers" under the IPv4 method in the network setting of the selected interface.  

### Other Educational material 
[Here](https://xilinx.github.io/RFSoC2x2-PYNQ/educational_resources.html) we can find a lot more educational material to support the Zynq RFSoC and the RFSoC2x2. This content has been developed by the University of Strathclyde in partnership with Xilinx. We recommend to follow these [RFSoC introductory notebooks](https://github.com/strath-sdr/rfsoc_notebooks).
